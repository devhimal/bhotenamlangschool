                Pasang Tamang, a bright 12-year-old from a small Himalayan
                village, dreams of becoming a doctor to serve his underserved
                community. Despite his family&apos;s financial struggles, Pasang
                excels in school, studying by a dim kerosene lamp and walking
                miles each day to attend classes. Your support can provide him
                with essential school supplies and better educational
                opportunities, turning his dreams into reality and inspiring his
                entire village. Join us in helping Pasang achieve his goals and
                bring hope to his community.
